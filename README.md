# About Mini ERP(Enterprise Resource Planning) Program
### - The program was created with Windows Forms with C#.
### - Program; It has screens for Customer, Order, Stock, Production, Work Order, Report transactions, and Main Report Page.
### - I fixed some bugs in this program I prepared for my internship, but I did not have time to fix all the bugs. I will fix other bugs in this project as soon as possible. I will upload the final version of the project here.
### - Patches were added to each page instead of classes in Database operations in the project. I specified  those fields as DB, instead of this, you can control the DB from one place.
### - File editing has been done.
### - The database path lines to be added to the pages have been specified and this path addition needs to be done in the App.config file.
