# The program was created with Windows Forms.
# Program; It has screens for Customer, Order, Stock, Production, Work Order and Report transactions.
# I fixed some bugs in this program I prepared for my internship, but I did'nt have time to fix all the bugs.
  I will fix the other bugs and update this Repository as soon as I am available and complete the project.
# Patches were added to each page instead of classes in Database operations in the project. I specified 
  those fields as DB, instead you can control the DB from one place.
