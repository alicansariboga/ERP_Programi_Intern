# - The program was created with Windows Forms.
# - Program; It has screens for Customer, Order, Stock, Production, Work Order, and Report transactions.
# - I fixed some bugs in this program I prepared for my internship, but I did not have time to fix all the bugs. I will fix other bugs in this project as soon as possible. I will upload the final version of the project here.
# - Patches were added to each page instead of classes in Database operations in the project. I specified  those fields as DB, instead of this, you can control the DB from one place.
